      <description>This is a story about summer, childhood, and forces trying to take them away. It is directed, but not entirely written, by me. The writers are the players. I will post a new day regularly, then it&amp;rsquo;s up to you! Play the game, make choices, save summer! The choices you make in game, and how well you do playing it, determines how the story unfolds!
The game will send me the data about your play though.</description>
