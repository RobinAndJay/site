This is a story about summer, childhood, and forces trying to take them away. It is
directed, but not entirely written, by me. The writers are the players. I will post
a new day regularly (probably about once a month), then it's up to you! Play the
game, make choices, save summer! The choices you make in game, and how well you
do playing it, determines how the story unfolds!

The game will send me the data about your play though. Once data collection ends,
I'll compile it and see what direction the story will take from there! I'll even
do a post-mortem blog post, explaining what data was collected, how I interpreted the data
and what that means going forward.

The choices in the game are not the only way the story can change! Find out more about me
and how you can help shape the story [here](/featured/me/)
