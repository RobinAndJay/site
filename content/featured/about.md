This is a story about summer, childhood, and forces trying to take them away. It is
directed, but not entirely written, by me. The writers are the players. I will post
a new day regularly, then it's up to you! Play the game, make choices, save summer!
The choices you make in game, and how well you do playing it, determines how the
story unfolds!

The game will send me the data about your play though. Once data collection ends,
I'll compile it and see what direction the story will take from there! I'll even
do a post-mortem blog post, explaining what data was collected, how I interpreted the data
and what that means going forward.

The choices in the game are not the only way the story can change! I'll try to be
very active on both [discord](https://discord.gg/m88q7vt) and [twitter](https://twitter.com/noofbiz).
I'm always open for suggestions and help on there!

Ready to help shape the story?
