My name is Jerry Caligiure, and I'm a talentless hack who figured out how to turn
hundreds of video game assets, a hand-crafted game engine, and the hivemind of
the intertubes into an interesting story. I think.

If you like my work, and want to see more, consider becoming a [patron](https://www.patreon.com/noofbiz).
This will help me work more on this project, as well as have benefits for patrons
such as early-release copies of the episodes, as well as a desktop-native version
of each day you can play outside the browser!
