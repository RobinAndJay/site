My name is Jerry Caligiure, and I'm a talentless hack who figured out how to turn
hundreds of video game assets, a hand-crafted game engine, and the hivemind of
the intertubes into an interesting story. I think.

You can help shape the story by playing the games and responding to surveys and
inputs on the game pages. I'll try to be very active on both [discord](https://discord.gg/m88q7vt) and [twitch](https://twitch.tv/noofbiz).
